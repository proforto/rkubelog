# Papertrail-go
Papertrail-go is a Go (golang) library built using Go modules for shipping logs to [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/) using syslog over udp or tcp or tls.
> __Warning:__ This is a Go library project. It will **NOT** produce a consumable executable.

## Papertrail
In order to ship logs to Papertrail, you will need a Papertrail account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for one [here](https://www.papertrail.com/). After you are logged in, you will need to create a `Log Destination` from under the `Settings` menu. When a log destination is created, you will be given a host:port combo.
